    <p>This Investment Growth Calculator helps you estimate how much your money could grow by the time you retire. Simply enter your initial investment amount, your expected annual interest rate, and your planned year of retirement. When you click the submit button, the calculator determines how many years your money will have to grow and applies the compound interest formula to project its future value. Compound interest means your investment earns interest not only on the original amount you invested, but also on the interest that builds up over time. The result is then displayed as a complete sentence showing the estimated total value of your investment at retirement. This tool is designed to give you a clear, easy-to-understand estimate to help you plan for your financial future.</p>
